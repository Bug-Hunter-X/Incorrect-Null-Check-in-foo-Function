This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating an uncommon error related to null checks. The `foo` function throws an error if either `a` or `b` is null. However, this check is overly strict, as it also throws an error when `a` or `b` is 0 (a falsy value). This unexpected behavior can be addressed by using the strict equality operator (`===`) instead of the loose equality operator (`==`).
